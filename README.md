# dir-splitter

Splits files with common roots within a directory tree, based on file extension

## Why does this exist?

Main reason is photos. When you take pictures with a camera in RAW + JPG mode, you end up with both files mixed in the same directory.

Transfer the files to proper storage, then it's useful to split out the files that have multiple versions, from the ones that were only taken in one mode. This will let you do that.
